This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to implicit type conversion within functions. The `f` function aims to return the absolute value of its input. However, due to VBScript's dynamic typing, the return type isn't explicitly defined and can lead to unexpected behavior depending on the execution path within the conditional statement. The `bug.vbs` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.vbs` offers a corrected version.  The bug arises from the implicit type conversion between integer and variant types.
